    The instructions for the Rails portfolio project say that the fields withn the app:
    "...should be enclosed within a fields_with_errors class" - and yet this is only
    necessary if you use a "form_tag" ActionView helper method instead of a "form_for"
    ActionView helper method; the latter are used for forms rendering an object model whereas
    the former are used for forms rendering items without associated object models.

    Although a User model exists in the project, I am using a form_tag here to demonstrate
    usage of the "field_with_errors" class as shown in the Flatiron cirriculum here:
    https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v8/module-13-rails/section-6-validations-and-forms/validations-with-form_tag
    The "field_with_errors" division is defined in here: app/assets/stylesheets/users.scss
    ...and although it is located inside the users.scss directory, all of the other forms
    (for trips & vehicles) are somehow finding it.  If I put something here:
    app/assets/stylesheets/trips.scss, it will not work so long as something in
    app/assets/stylesheets/users.scss already exists.
